# 🧩 **Homework JS DOM: Interactive To-Do & Notes Dashboard**

## 🎯 **Objective:**

Build an interactive **To-Do & Notes Dashboard** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project will focus on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **dynamic content updates** without using any libraries or frameworks.

## 📄 **Project Description:**

You will create a web-based dashboard that includes:

1. A **To-Do List**: where users can add, delete, mark tasks as complete, and filter tasks.
2. A **Sticky Notes Section**: where users can add and remove short notes.
3. A **Live Clock** and **Greeting Message** based on the time of day.
4. A **Theme Switcher**: allowing users to toggle between dark and light mode.
5. A **Local Storage Integration** (optional/bonus): save todos and notes locally.
